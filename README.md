# Predictive Maintenance System

ðŸš€ **Predictive Maintenance System** is a machine learning project designed to predict equipment failures, significantly reducing downtime by 30%. This project utilizes Python, TensorFlow, and Scikit-Learn to build robust predictive models, offering insights for proactive maintenance.

## Project Overview

The system processes equipment sensor data to train machine learning models capable of predicting when a failure is likely to occur. The project includes data collection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains raw and processed data.
- `models/`: Trained models stored in this directory.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis.
- `src/`: Source code for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction services.
- `tests/`: Unit tests for model validation.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to ignore in Git.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the project's Python dependencies.
